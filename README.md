Air Quality Monitoring System

Project Overview
This project aims to build a Real-Time Urban Air Quality Monitoring and Predictive Analytics System to monitor air pollution levels in urban areas. By deploying IoT-based sensors to measure pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, and CO2, the system provides valuable insights into air quality, enabling individuals and communities to make informed decisions for their health and surroundings. This solution is affordable, scalable, and can be used to guide policymakers in pollution mitigation efforts.

Problem Statement
Urban air pollution is a growing environmental concern affecting public health, quality of life, and the environment. However, monitoring air quality at a local level remains challenging due to the high cost of equipment and the lack of real-time, accessible data. This project addresses these issues by creating an affordable and scalable monitoring system that provides accurate and timely data, allowing residents and policymakers to respond effectively to pollution.

Solution Overview
The Air Quality Monitoring System uses IoT sensors to gather real-time data on key air pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, and CO2, along with environmental factors like temperature and humidity. This data is then sent to a cloud-based platform, where it is processed and visualized on a web dashboard for easy access and analysis.

Key Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Collects data on air quality and environmental factors in real-time.
Data Visualization: Displays pollution levels

Solutions
Solution Approach for Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring System
1. Hardware Components
The following components are required to build the physical setup for monitoring air quality:

Sensors:
MQ-135: For measuring air quality (detects CO2, ammonia, benzene, and other harmful gases).
MQ-7: For measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels.
PM2.5 & PM10 Sensor: For measuring particulate matter in the air (PM2.5 and PM10).
DHT11/DHT22: For measuring temperature and humidity.

Microcontroller:
NodeMCU (ESP8266) or ESP32: These microcontrollers come with built-in Wi-Fi, making them suitable for IoT applications by allowing the device to send data to a web server.

Power Supply:
5V USB Power Supply: To power the microcontroller and sensors.

Breadboard and Connecting Wires:
Jumper Wires and Breadboard: For setting up the circuit connections between the sensors and the microcontroller.

2. Software Requirements

Arduino IDE:
Use the Arduino IDE to program the NodeMCU/ESP32 microcontroller. Arduino libraries are also available for the sensors, making it easier to read data from them.
Backend Server and Database:
Firebase, AWS, or ThingSpeak can be used to collect and store the sensor data in real-time.
Node.js with Express can be used for setting up a custom backend API if needed.

Web Dashboard: HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end development.
Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization to display pollution levels on a real-time dashboard.
AJAX/WebSockets for live updates.
Data Analysis and Prediction (optional):
Python with libraries like Scikit-Learn for machine learning if you want to add predictive analytics.

3. System Architecture
The proposed architecture of the system is as follows:

Data Collection:

The sensors (MQ-135, MQ-7, PM2.5/PM10 sensor, DHT11) collect data on pollutants and environmental conditions.
This data is read by the microcontroller (NodeMCU/ESP32) via analog or digital pins.
Data Transmission:

The microcontroller transmits the collected data to a cloud-based server (Firebase, AWS IoT, or ThingSpeak) over Wi-Fi.
Data is sent at regular intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds) to minimize network usage while ensuring real-time updates.
Data Processing and Storage:

The cloud server receives the data and stores it in a database.
Processing includes applying calibration formulas to ensure accurate readings and possibly averaging the data over time.
Data Visualization:

The web dashboard fetches data from the cloud server and displays real-time and historical pollution levels.
Visualization includes graphs for PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, temperature, and humidity levels.
Alert features can be implemented to notify users if pollutant levels exceed safe thresholds.
Predictive Analysis (Optional):

Using a machine learning model to predict air quality trends based on historical data.
Displaying predictions on the dashboard to inform users about possible future pollution levels.

4. Implementation Steps

Step 1: Hardware Setup
Connect the MQ-135 and MQ-7 sensors to the analog/digital pins of the microcontroller.
Connect the PM2.5/PM10 sensor for particulate matter detection.
Connect the DHT11/DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity readings.
Use a breadboard and jumper wires to set up connections. Ensure each sensor is connected to both power and ground.
Power the microcontroller with a 5V USB power supply.

Step 2: Programming the Microcontroller
Write code in the Arduino IDE to read data from each sensor and send it to the cloud.
Use libraries such as Adafruit_MQ135, DHT, and specific libraries for PM2.5/PM10 if available.
Set up the microcontroller to connect to Wi-Fi and transmit data to the cloud service you selected (e.g., Firebase).

Step 3: Setting Up the Cloud Server
Choose a cloud platform (Firebase, AWS IoT, or ThingSpeak).
Create an account and set up a database or channel for data storage.
Configure the database to accept incoming data from the microcontroller and store it with timestamps.

Step 4: Developing the Web Dashboard
Design a front-end dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use AJAX/WebSockets to enable live data updates.
Use Chart.js or D3.js to display data in graphical form, making it easy to visualize trends.
Implement thresholds for each pollutant, setting up alerts or color changes in the dashboard when levels exceed safe limits.

Step 5: Data Analysis and Prediction (Optional)
If you want to include predictions, use Python to build a machine learning model based on historical data.
Train the model to predict pollution levels based on past trends.
Integrate this prediction into the web dashboard, showing forecasted air quality levels.

Step 6: Testing and Calibration
Test the system in different locations to verify that sensor readings are accurate.
Calibrate the sensors based on the environment to improve the accuracy of the data.

Step 7: Final Deployment and Documentation
Once tested, deploy the sensors in designated locations.
Document the project, including setup, functionality, and usage instructions.
5. Cost-Effective Considerations
To make the system affordable:
Use low-cost sensors like the MQ series, which offer a reasonable accuracy level at a low price.
Optimize data transmission to reduce bandwidth usage (e.g., sending data every 10 seconds instead of continuously).
Consider using open-source software for backend and visualization.

6. Tasks for Team Members
